# SOC_ChatBot

# Project Overview

This project was undertaken as part of the Summer of Code (SOC) by WNCC. The primary focus was on exploring and utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for various tasks, including inference, fine-tuning, and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The project aimed to harness the power of LLMs for efficient and accurate information retrieval and response generation, making it suitable for various applications such as chatbots, automated customer service, and more.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout this project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of:

1. **LLM Inference**: I explored how to utilize pre-trained LLMs for inference, enabling them to generate meaningful text outputs based on provided prompts. This involved understanding the architecture of LLMs, tokenization, and the significance of model parameters in producing accurate results.

2. **Fine-Tuning LLMs**: I learned the process of fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on domain-specific data. This included data preparation, adjusting hyperparameters, and using transfer learning techniques to enhance the model's performance on specific tasks. The fine-tuned models were evaluated on their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses.

3. **Building a RAG Pipeline**: The core of the project was the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This involved integrating information retrieval systems with LLMs to create a more robust and context-aware response generation framework. The RAG pipeline was designed to retrieve relevant information from a predefined knowledge base and use it to generate accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

## Project Components

1. **Code for Inference and Fine-Tuning**: The repository includes scripts for running inference with pre-trained LLMs and fine-tuning them on custom datasets. These scripts are modular and can be adapted for various use cases, making them versatile for different projects.

2. **RAG Pipeline Implementation**: The RAG pipeline is implemented using a combination of retrieval and generation techniques. The retrieval component fetches relevant documents or text snippets from the knowledge base, while the generation component uses the retrieved information to produce a final output. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide informed and accurate responses.

3. **Documentation and Notes**: Detailed documentation is provided to guide users through the setup, usage, and customization of the project. The notes include insights into the challenges faced during the project, solutions implemented, and potential improvements for future work.
